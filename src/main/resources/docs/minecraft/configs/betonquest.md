About Scripting
BetonQuest's quests do not have a predefined structure and can be freely designed. This is made possible by a powerful quest scripting language.

Building BlocksðŸ”—
The BetonQuest scripting language is based on a few basic building blocks which are outlined in the following sections. They can be freely combined to create any quest you want. All of these are defined using an instruction text.

Instruction Text Example

conditions: 
  myCondition: "health 10" 
events:
  myEvent: "hunger set 20"
objectives:
  myObjective: "mobkill ZOMBIE 10"
EventsðŸ”—
In certain moments you will want something to happen. Updating the journal, setting tags, giving rewards, all these are done using events. You define them by specifying a name and instruction string like shown above. At the end of the instruction string you can add the conditions: (with or without s at the end) attribute followed by a list of condition names separated by commas, like conditions:angry,!quest_started. This will make an event fire only when these conditions are met.

Explore all Events

ObjectivesðŸ”—
Objective are goals that player must complete. At first, they must be started for a player with the objective event. When the player completes the objective, all defined events are run. For example, you could reward the player by giving them an item.

You define them in the objectives section as shown above. At the end of the instruction text you can add conditions and events for the objective. Conditions will limit when the objective can be completed (e.g. killing zombies only at given location), and events will fire when the objective is completed (e.g. giving a reward, or setting a tag which will enable collecting a reward from an NPC). You define these like that: conditions:con1,con2 events:event1,event2 at the end of instruction text. Separate them by commas and never use spaces!

If you want to start an objective right after it was completed you can add the persistent argument at the end of its instruction string. For example, you could create a custom respawn system with a die objective. When the player dies, they will be teleported to the spawnpoint and the die objective will be started again. The persistent argument prevents the objective from being completed, although it will run all its events. To cancel such an objective you need to use objective delete event.

Example

objectives:
  mineDiamonds: 'block DIAMONDS -10 events:reward'
  die: 'die cancel respawn:100;200;300;world;90;0 events:sendRespawnMessage conditions:hasCustomTotem'
Global objectivesðŸ”—
If you want an objective to be active for every player right after joining, you can create a global objective. This is done by adding global argument to the instruction of the objective. When you then reload BetonQuest it is started for all online players and also will be started for every player who joins.

Possible use cases would be a quest which starts if a player reaches a specific location or breaks a specific block.

To prevent the objective from being started every time a player joins, a tag is set for the player whenever the objective is started. With this tag, the objective will not be started again.
These tags follow the syntax <package>.global-<id>, where <id> is the objectives id and <package> the package where the objective is located.

Example

objectives:
  startQuestByMining: 'location 100;200;300;world 5 events:start_quest_mine_folder global'
VariablesðŸ”—
Use with caution!

The updating behaviour of already started objectives might change in BetonQuest 3. Perhaps variable changes will be reflected in the amount of an active objective. This is not the case right now.

Objectives support variables for their amount options. When the objective is started for a player, the amount is set to the variable's current value. The amount of an active objective will not be updated if the variable changes. Also, when the variable contains an invalid value for the given objective (e.g. a negative value) a default value of 1 is used.

Examples

objectives:
  killMonsters: 'mobkill ZOMBIE %math.calc:(100-{point.reputation.amount})*2% events:endSiege'
  breakObsidian: 'block OBSIDIAN %randomnumber.whole.-60~-40% events:dailyReward'
  eatSteak: 'consume steak amount:%randomnumber.whole.2~6% events:health_boost'
Explore all Objectives

ConditionsðŸ”—
Conditions allow you to control what options are available to players in conversations, how the NPC responds or if the objective will be completed. They check if a given in-game state is present and return true or false as a result.

You can negate the condition (revert its output) by adding an exclamation mark (!) at the beginning of its name. This only works in the place where conditions are used (i.e. in conversations, not in the conditions section). If you do so, make sure to enclose the condition in quotes, otherwise YAML will give you a syntax error.

Example

conditions:
  hasFullHealth: "health 20"
events:
  helpWithHealing: "hunger set 20 conditions:!hasFullHealth"
Explore all Conditions

TagsðŸ”—
Tags are little pieces of text you can assign to player. They are particularly useful to determine if player has started or completed quest. They are given with tag event and checked with tag condition. All tags are bound to a package, so if you add the questCompleted tag from within a package named monsterQuest, the tag will look like monsterQuest.questCompleted.

Read working across packages to learn how to work with tags across packages.

PointsðŸ”—
Points are numbers that can be assigned to a player. You can set them with the point event. you want. You can also take the points away, even to negative numbers. Of course then you can check if player has (or doesn't have) certain amount with the point condition. They can be used as counter for specific number of quest done, as a reputation system in villages or even an NPC's attitude to player.

Packages & Templates
PackagesðŸ”—
All quests you create are organized into packages. A single package can contain one or multiple quests - it's up to your liking. It is very important to have a good understand of packages. Read the packages chapter carefully.

StructureðŸ”—
A package is a folder with a "package.yml" file. It must be placed inside the "BetonQuest/QuestPackages" directory.
Additionally, you can create extra files or sub-folders inside a package to organize your quest the way you want. Sub-folders of packages that contain a "package.yml" are separate packages, they do not belong to the surrounding package in any way.

Let's take a look at a few examples:

Structure Examples

Every quest package is surrounded with a blue box.


Simple Package
Complex Package
Nested Packages
A very simple package. It's defined by the package.yml and has two additional files.



Defining featuresðŸ”—
You can freely define features (events, conversations, items etc.) in all files of a quest package. However, they need to be defined in a section that defines their type.

The names of these features must be unique in that package, no matter which file they are in.

Example
Working across PackagesðŸ”—
Accessing features from other packages can be very helpful to link quests together. All events, conditions, objectives, items and conversations can be accessed.

You never need to access a specific file since feature names are unique within a package.

Top-Level PackagesðŸ”—
You can access top-level packages (placed directly in "QuestPackages") by prefixing the feature's name with a greater than (>) and the package name.

Example
Packages in Sub-foldersðŸ”—
You can access packages in sub-folders by prefixing the feature's name with the package name and the path from the "QuestPackages" folder to the package.

Example
Relative pathsðŸ”—
You can specify relative paths to a package instead of full paths. The underscore (_) means "one folder up" from the current packages "package.yml". In turn, a leading dash (-) combined with a folder name navigates "one folder down" into the given folder. Each package in the path must be separated by a dash.

This can be useful when distributing or moving packages. Instead of rewriting every package path to match the current location, relative paths will still work.

Example
Disabling PackagesðŸ”—
Packages are enabled by default, you can disable a package if you don't want it to be loaded. Set enabled inside the package section to true or false to enable or disable the package.


package:
  ## Optionally add this to the package.yml
  enabled: false
Package VersionðŸ”—
Each package has a version inside the package section that is used by the automatic migrator. When no version is set the newest version will be set on loading. Any new package section will be added at the end of the file, so you probably want to move that to the file's top.

Info

When updating from a version before versioning see Migration to BQ 3.0.


package:
  version: 3.0.0-QUEST-1 # Don't change this! The plugin's automatic quest updater handles it.
TemplatesðŸ”—
You should have experience creating and using packages before you start using templates. Templates are a way to create packages that can be used as a base for other packages to reduce the amount of repetitive work. Therefore, they are a great way to centralize logic or create utilities.

Using TemplatesðŸ”—
Templates work exactly like packages, except that they are placed in the "BetonQuest/QuestTemplates" folder instead of the "BetonQuest/QuestPackages" folder and that they are not loaded as a ready to use package. Instead, they are used as a base for other packages by referring to them in the templates section inside the package section.


package:
  templates:
    - MyTemplate
    - SecondTemplate
If you use the above in a package, the MyTemplate and SecondTemplate templates would be used as a base for the package. This means that all the events, objectives, conditions, etc. from the templates would be added to the package. If the package already contains an event/objective/condition with the same name as one from the template, the package's events, objectives, conditions, etc. will be used instead of the one from the template.

If the same events, objectives, conditions, etc. is defined in multiple templates, the one from the lists first template will be used.

You can also use templates in templates. Also in this case, the events, objectives, conditions, etc. that are defined in the current template will be used instead of the ones from the template that is being used as a base.

Events ListðŸ”—
Burn: burnðŸ”—
Parameter	Syntax	Default Value	Explanation
duration	duration:number		The duration the player will burn (in seconds). Can be a variable.
Example

events:
  burn: "burn duration:4"
  punishing_fire: "burn duration:%point.punishment.amount%"
Cancel a quest: cancelðŸ”—
This event works in the same way as a quest canceler in the backpack.

Running this event is equal to the player canceling a quest using the backpack.

Parameter	Syntax	Default Value	Explanation
canceler	CancelerID		The Quest Canceler to execute.
bypass	Keyword (bypass)	Disabled	If the canceler conditions should be ignored. If enabled the canceler will be executed, even when its conditions are not met.
Example

cancelQuest: "cancel woodQuest bypass"
Cancel the Conversation: cancelconversationðŸ”—
Cancels the active conversation of the player.

Example

  events:
    cancel: "cancelconversation"
Chat player message chatðŸ”—
This event will send the given message as the player. Therefore, it will look like as if the player did send the message. The instruction string is the command, without leading slash. You can only use %player% as a variable in this event. Additional messages can be defined by separating them with | character. If you want to use a | character in the message use \|.

If a plugin does not work with the sudo / command event you need to use this event.

Example


sendMSG: "chat Hello!"
sendMultipleMSGs: "chat Hi %player%|ban %player%|pardon %player%"
sendPluginCommand: "chat /someCommand x y z"
Chest Clear: chestclearðŸ”—
persistent, static

This event removes all items from a chest at specified location. The only argument is a location.

Example


chestclear 100;200;300;world
Chest Give: chestgiveðŸ”—
persistent, static

This works the same as give event, but it puts the items in a chest at specified location. The first argument is a location, the second argument is a list of items, like in give event. If the chest is full, the items will be dropped on the ground. The chest can be any other block with inventory, i.e. a hopper or a dispenser. BetonQuest will log an error to the console when this event is fired but there is no chest at specified location.

Example


chestgive 100;200;300;world emerald:5,sword
Chest Take: chesttakeðŸ”—
persistent, static

This event works the same as take event, but it takes items from a chest at specified location. The instruction string is defined in the same way as in chestgive event.

Example


chesttake 100;200;300;world emerald:5,sword
Compass: compassðŸ”—
When you run this event, you can add or remove a compass destination for the player. You may also directly set the player's compass destination as well. When a destination is added the player will be able to select a specified location as a target of his compass. To select the target the player must open his backpack and click on the compass icon. The first argument is add,del or set, and second one is the name of the target, as defined in the compass section. Note that if you set a target the player will not automatically have it added to their choices.

The destination must be defined in compass section. You can specify a name for the target in each language or just give a general name, and optionally add a custom item (from items section) to be displayed in the backpack. Example of a compass target:


compass:
  beton:
    name:
      en-US: Target
      pl-PL: Cel
    location: 100;200;300;world
    item: scroll
Example


compass add beton
Command: commandðŸ”—
persistent, static

Runs specified command from the console. The instruction string is the command, without leading slash. You can use variables here, but variables other than %player% won't resolve if the event is fired from delayed folder and the player is offline now. You can define additional commands by separating them with | character. If you want to use a | character in the command use \|.

Looking for run command as player?

Example


command kill %player%|ban %player%
Conversation: conversationðŸ”—
Starts a conversation at location of the player. The first argument is ID of the conversation. This bypasses the conversation permission!

The optional option argument is a NPC option where the conversation will start. When using this argument the conversation will start without its header.

Example


conversation village_smith
conversation tutorial option:explain_world
Damage player: damageðŸ”—
Damages the player by specified amount of damage. The only argument is a number (can have floating point).

Example


damage 20
Delete Point: deletepointðŸ”—
persistent, static

Clear all player points in a specified category.

Example


deletepoint npc_attitude
Delete Globalpoint: deleteglobalpointðŸ”—
persistent, static

Removes the specified category from the global points list.


deleteBonus: "deleteglobalpoint bonus"
Door: doorðŸ”—
persistent, static

This event can open and close doors, trapdoors and fence gates. The syntax is exactly the same as in lever event above.

Example


door 100;200;300;world off
Drop Item: dropðŸ”—
static

Drops the defined items at a defined location. The event takes two parameters: items and location. Items is a list of items to be dropped. Every item can optionally be followed by a colon to define an amount <item>:<amount> otherwise the amount is 1. The optional location defines where the items will be dropped. It must be specified in the unified location format. If no location is given then the items will be dropped at the player's current location.

If the drop event is used in a schedule then the items will be dropped at the given location. If no location is given then the items will be dropped for every player at their respective locations.


drop items:magical_sword location:200;17;300;world
drop items:loot_rare,loot_common:3
drop items:myItem location:%objective.MyQuestVariables.DropLocation%
Remove Potion Effect: deleffectðŸ”—
Removes the specified potion effects from the player. Use any instead of a list of types to remove all potion effects from the player. Alternatively to any, you just can leave it blank.

Example


deleffect ABSORPTION,BLINDNESS
deleffect any
deleffect
Potion Effect: effectðŸ”—
Adds a specified potion effect to player. First argument is potion type. You can find all available types here. Second is integer defining how long the effect will last in seconds. Third argument, also integer, defines level of the effect (1 means first level). Add a parameter ambient to make potion particles appear more invisible (just like beacon effects). To hide particles add a parameter hidden. To hide the icon for the effect add noicon.

Example


effect BLINDNESS 30 1 ambient icon
Eval Event: evalðŸ”—
This event allows you to resolve an expression containing variables, and the result will then be interpreted again as an event.

Example

events:
  simpleEval: eval notify "This is actually an eval event evaluating to a notify event."
  complexEval: eval point ranking 5 action:add %objective.settings.notify% 
Give experience: experienceðŸ”—
This event allows you to manipulate player's experience. First you specify a number as the amount, then the modification action. You can use action:addExperience, action:addLevel, action:setExperienceBar and action:setLevel as modification types.

To use this correctly, you need to understand this:

A player has experience points.
Experience levels, shown are shown as a number in the experience bar. Every level requires more experience points than the previous.
The experience bar itself shows the percentage of the experience points needed to reach the next level.
While action:addExperience only adds experience points, action:addLevel adds a level and keeps the current percentage. action:setExperienceBar sets the progress of the bar. Decimal values between 0 and 1 represent the fill level. This changes the underlying experience points, it's not just a visual change. action:setLevel sets only the level, expect if you specify a decimal number, then the experience bar will be set to the specified percentage.

Example

add15XP: "experience 15 action:addExperience"
add4andAHalfLevel: "experience 4.5 action:addLevel"
remove2Level: "experience -2 action:addLevel"
setXPBar: "experience 0.5 action:setExperienceBar"
resetLevel: "experience 0.01 action:setLevel"
Explosion: explosionðŸ”—
persistent, static

Creates an explosion. It can make fire and destroy blocks. You can also define power, so be careful not to blow your server away. Default TNT power is 4, while Wither on creation is 7. First argument can be 0 or 1 and states if explosion will generate fire (like Ghast's fireball). Second is also 0 or 1 but this defines if block will be destroyed or not. Third argument is the power (float number). At the end (4th attribute) there is location.

Example


explosion 0 1 4 100;64;-100;survival
 Run multiple events: folderðŸ”—
persistent, static

This event wraps multiple events inside itself. Once triggered, it simply executes it's events. This is usefully to easily refer to a bunch of events at once, e.g. in a conversation.

Events marked as persistent will be fired even after the player logs out. Beware though, all conditions are false when the player is offline (even inverted ones), so those events should not be blocked by any conditions!
You can use the cancelOnLogout argument to stop the folder executing any remaining events if the player disconnects.

Parameter	Syntax	Default Value	Explanation
events to run	eventName1,event2		One or multiple events to run. Contains event names seperated by commas.
delay	Keyword	without delay	The delay before the folder starts executing it's events.
period	period:number	without delay	The time between each event of the folder.
time unit	unit:unit	Seconds	The unit of time to use for delay and period. Either ticks, minutes or seconds.
random	random:number	Disabled	Enables "random mode". Will randomly pick the defined amount of events .
cancelOnLogout	Keyword	Disabled	If enabled, the folder will stop executing events if the player disconnects.
cancelConditions	cancelConditions:cond1,cond2	Disabled	If enabled, the folder will stop executing events if the conditions are true.
Examples

events:
  simpleFolder: "folder event1,event2,event3" 
  runEvents: "folder event1,event2,event3 delay:5 period:1" 
  troll: "folder killPlayer,banPlayer,kickPlayer delay:5 random:1" 
  wait: "folder messagePlayer,giveReward delay:1 unit:minutes" 
If-else through a list of events: firstðŸ”—
This event wraps multiple events inside itself, similar folder. Unlike folder, it attempts to execute each event, starting from the first onward. Once it successfully executes one event, it stops executing the rest. This is useful for collapsing long if-else chains into single events.

This event is especially powerful when it is used in conjunction with the conditions: keyword, which can be used with any event.

Example

events: 
  firstExample: "first event1,event2,event3"
  event1: "point carry boxes 10 action:add conditions:firstCondition"
  event2: "point carry boxes 20 action:add conditions:secondCondition"
  event3: "point carry boxes 40 action:add conditions:thirdCondition"
Equivalent using if-else

events:
  firstExample: "if firstCondition event1 else firstExample2"
  firstExample2: "if secondCondition event2 else firstExample3"
  firstExample3: "if thirdCondition event3"
  event1: "point carry boxes 10 action:add"
  event2: "point carry boxes 20 action:add"
  event3: "point carry boxes 40 action:add"
Give Items: giveðŸ”—
Gives the player predefined items. They are specified exactly as in item condition - list separated by commas, every item can have amount separated by colon. Default amount is 1. If the player doesn't have required space in the inventory, the items are dropped on the ground, unless they are quest items. Then they will be put into the backpack. You can also specify notify keyword to display a simple message to the player about receiving items. The optional backpack argument forces quest items to be placed in the backpack.

Example


give emerald:5,emerald_block:9
give important_sign notify backpack
Give journal: givejournalðŸ”—
This event simply gives the player his journal. It acts the same way as /j command would.

Example


givejournal
Global point: globalpointðŸ”—
persistent, static

This works the same way as the normal point event but instead to manipulating the points for a category of a specific player it manipulates points in a global category. These global categories are player independent, so you could for example add a point to such a global category every time a player does a quest and give some special rewards for the 100th player who does the quest.

Example


globalpoint global_knownusers 1 action:add
globalpoint daily_login 0 action:set
globalpoint reputaion 2 action:multiply
Global tag: globaltagðŸ”—
persistent, static

Works the same way as a normal tag event, but instead of setting a tag for one player it sets it globally for all players.

Example


globaltag add global_areNPCsAgressive
Hunger: hungerðŸ”—
This event changes the food level of the player. The second argument is the modification type. There are give, take and set. The second argument is the amount. With set can the food level be anything. If give or take is specified the final amount won't be more than 20 or less than 0. If the hunger level is below 7, the player cannot sprint.

Example


hunger set 20
hunger give 5
If else: ifðŸ”—
persistent, static

This event will check a condition, and based on the outcome it will run the first or second event. The instruction string is if condition event1 else event2, where condition is a condition ID and event1 and event2 are event IDs. else keyword is mandatory between events for no practical reason. Keep in mind that this event is persistent and static but probably the condition or the events are not.

Example


if sun rain else sun
Item durability: itemdurabilityðŸ”—
Adds or removes durability from an item in the slot. The first argument is the slot, the second the change of durability and the third the amount. Optional arguments are ignoreUnbreakable to ignore the unbreakable flag and unbreaking enchantment and ignoreEvents to bypass event logic, so other plugins will not be able to interfere. Available slot types: HAND, OFF_HAND, HEAD, CHEST, LEGS, FEET.

Info

Both increasing and decreasing durability will be affected by the unbreaking enchantment. To prevent this behaviour use the ignoreUnbreakable argument.

Example


itemdurability HAND ADD 1
itemdurability CHEST SUBTRACT %randomnumber.whole.15~30% ignoreUnbreakable ignoreEvents
Journal: journalðŸ”—
static

Adds or deletes an entry to/from a player's journal. Journal entries have to be defined in the journal section. The first argument is the action to perform, the second one is the name of the entry if required. Changing journal entries will also reload the journal.

Possible actions are: - add: Adds a page to the journal. - delete: Deletes a page from the journal. - update: Refreshes the journal. This is especially useful when you need to update the main page.

Example


journal add quest_started
journal delete quest_available
journal update
Kill: killðŸ”—
Kills the player. Nothing else.

Language Event: languageðŸ”—
persistent

This event changes player's language to the specified one. There is only one argument, the language name.

Example


language en
Lever: leverðŸ”—
persistent, static

This event can switch a lever. The first argument is a location and the second one is state: on, off or toggle.

Example


lever 100;200;300;world toggle
Lightning: lightningðŸ”—
static

Strikes a lightning at given location. The first argument is the location. By adding noDamage the lightning is only an effect and therefor does no damage.

Examples

events:
  strikeLightning: lightning 100;64;-100;survival
  showEntrance: lightning 200;65;100;survival noDamage
Sending Notifications: notifyðŸ”—
You can send notifications using the notify event. This is how to use it:

Warning

All colons (:) in the message part of the notification need to be escaped, including those inside variables. One backslash (\) is required when using no quoting at all (...) or single quotes ('...'). Two backslashes are required (\\) when using double quotes ("...").
You also need to escape the backslash itself, if you use double quotes for some things like \n.

Examples:
eventName: notify Peter:Heya %player%! âž¡ eventName: notify Peter\:Heya %player%!
eventName: 'notify Peter:Heya %player%!' âž¡ eventName: 'notify Peter\:Heya %player%!'
eventName: "notify Peter:Heya %player%!" âž¡ eventName: "notify Peter\\:Heya %player%!"
otherEvent: notify You own %math.calc:5% fish! âž¡ otherEvent: You own %math.calc\:5% fish!
newLine: "notify Some multiline \n message" âž¡ newLine: "notify Some multiline \\n message"

Parameter	Syntax	Default Value	Explanation
message	Any text with spaces!		The message that will be displayed. Supports variables and translations. Must be first
category	category:info	None	Will load all settings from that Notification Category. Can be a comma-seperated list. The first existent category will be used.
io	io:bossbar	io:chat	Any NotifyIO Overrides the "category". settings.
any io specific settings	setting:value	None	Some notifyIO's provide specific settings. Can be used multiple times. Overrides the "category" settings.
Usage ExamplesðŸ”—
Check out the notify IO specific options if you haven't yet. You must understand these two if you want to use the Notify system to it's full extend. Advanced users may also use Notify Categories to make their lives easier.


#The simplest of all notify events. Just a chat message:
customEvent: "notify Hello %player%!"  

#It's the same as this one since 'chat' is the default IO.
theSame: "notify Hello %player%! io:chat"

#This one displays a title and a subtitle:
myTitle: "notify This is a title.\\nThis is a subtitle. io:title"

#Plays a sound:
mySound: "notify io:sound sound:x.y.z"

#This one explicitly defines an io (bossbar) and adds one bossbarIO option + one soundIO option:
myBar: "notify This is a custom message. io:bossbar barColor:red sound:block.anvil.use"

#Some events with categories.
myEvent1: "notify This is a custom message! category:info"
myEvent2: "notify This is a custom message! category:firstChoice,secondChoice"

#You can also override category settings:
myEvent3: "notify Another message! category:info io:advancement frame:challenge"

#Use multiple languages:
multilanguage: "notify {en} Hello english person! {de} Hello german person! {es} Hello spanish person!"
TranslationsðŸ”—
Notifications can be translated with this syntax:


example: "notify {en} ABC {de} DEF"
The value in {} is a language key from messages.yml. Any text after the language key until the next language key belongs to the specified language. There must be a space between the language key and the message. In this example, english users would see ABC and german ones would see DEF.
BroadcastsðŸ”—
persistent, static

You can broadcast notifications to all players on the server using the notifyall event. It works just like the notify event. Variables are resolved for each online player, not for the player the event is executed for.

Example

events:
  announceDungeon: "notifyall A new dungeon has opened!"
Log message to console: logðŸ”—
persistent, static

Prints a provided message to the server log. Any variables used in the message will be resolved. Note that when used in static context (by schedules) replacing player dependent variables won't work as the event is player independent.

Parameter	Syntax	Default Value	Explanation
level	level:logLevel	INFO	Optionally the log level can be specified but only before the message.
There are 4 levels: debug, info, warning and error
Example

  events:
    logPlayer: "log %player% completed first quest."
    debug: "log level:DEBUG daily quests have been reset"
NPC Teleport: npcteleportðŸ”—
persistent, static

This event will teleport the Npc to the given location.

Parameter	Syntax	Default Value	Explanation
Npc	Npc		The ID of the Npc
Location	Unified Location Formatting		The location to which the Npc will be teleported
Spawn	Keyword (spawn)	Disabled	If the NPC should be spawned if not in the world
Example

teleportToSpawn: npcteleport mayorHans 100;200;300;world
Objective: objectiveðŸ”—
persistent, static

Adds, removes or completes the specified objective(s).

Parameter	Syntax	Default Value	Explanation
action	Keyword: add,remove,complete		The action to do with the objective(s).
objective(s)	objectiveName or obj1,obj2		The objective(s) to run the action on.
Using this in static contexts only works when removing objectives!


events:
  startQuest: "objective add killTheDragon,goToDungeon"
  progressQuest: "objective complete killTheDragon"
OPsudo: opsudoðŸ”—
This event is similar to the sudo event, the only difference is that it will fire a command as the player with temporary OP permissions. Additional commands can be defined by separating them with | character. If you want to use a | character in the message use \|. Variables are supported.

Looking for run as normal player? Looking for console commands?

Example


opsudo spawn
Party event: partyðŸ”—
This is part of the party system. Runs the specified list of events (third argument) for every player in the party. The last optional argument amount specifies a maximum number of players to select. Selected players will be picked from the party if they are in range and meet the conditions. Players are selected according to their distance from the player who triggered the event. For example, if the 'amount' is two, the player who triggered the event and the player closest to that player will be selected. A negative amount will select all players and therefore act as if there was no amount given.

Example


party 10 has_tag1,!has_tag2 give_reward
party 10 has_tag1,!has_tag2 give_special_reward amount:3
Pick random: pickrandomðŸ”—
persistent, static

Another container for events. It picks one (or multiple) of the given events and runs it. You must specify how likely it is that each event is picked by adding the weighting before the event's id. The weighting is a floating point number, that is the ratio of the event's chance to be picked.

It picks one event from the list by default, but you can add an optional amount: if you want more to be picked. Note that only as many events as specified can be picked and amount:0 will do nothing.

Example


pickrandom 20.5~event1,0.5~event2,79~event3 amount:2
pickrandom %point.factionXP.amount%~event1,0.5~event2,79~event3,1~event4 amount:3
Point: pointðŸ”—
persistent

This event allows you to manipulate player's points in a specified category. First you can specify a number of points, then the modification action. For that, you can use action:add, action:subtract, action:set and action:multiply as modification types. This event also supports an optional notify argument that will display information about the change using the notification system.

Example

gainAttitude: "point npc_attitude 5 action:add"
loseAttitude: "point npc_attitude 2 action:subtract"
resetCombo: "point combo 0 action:set"
boostPoints: "point points 1.25 action:multiply notify"
Remove entity: removeentityðŸ”—
persistent, static

Removes or kill all entities (mobs) of given type at the location. Here you can look up all type's of entity's.

Can only effect loaded entities!

Parameter	Syntax	Default Value	Explanation
entity(s)	entity,entity		Required. List of entity's (separated by ,).
location	Unified Location Formatting		Required. The center location of the target entity's.
radius	Number		Required. The radius around the location. Can be a variable.
name	name:name		Name of the entity. All _ will be replaced with spaces.

clearGameArea: "removeentity ARROW,SNOWBALL,WOLF,ARMOR_STAND 100;200;300;world 50 marked:minigame"
Run events: runðŸ”—
persistent, static

This event allows you to specify multiple instructions in one, long instruction. Each instruction must be started with the ^ character (it divides all the instructions). It's not the same as the folder event, because you have to specify the actual instruction, not an event name. Don't use conditions here, it behaves strangely.

Example


run ^tag add beton ^give emerald:5 ^entry add beton ^kill
Run events for all online players: runForAllðŸ”—
persistent, static

Runs the specified event (or list of events) once for each player on the server.

The most common use case is to run an event for all online players from a schedule. But you can also use it in conversations, objectives or other events.

To run the events only for a selection of players, use the where: option to filter for players that meet specific conditions.

Parameter	Syntax	Default Value	Explanation
events	events:events		Required. The events to be run, separated by ,.
where	where:conditions		A list of optional conditions (separated by ,) that are checked for every player.
The events supplied in events: are only executed for the players that meet all the given conditions.
Example

events:
    kickAll: "runForAll where:!isOp events:kickPlayer,restartQuest"
Warning

You can still append conditions to the runForAll event (e.g. runForAll events:kickPlayer conditions:!isOp).
This won't check the conditions for each player!
Instead it will check the conditions for the player that triggered the event or check them player independent if triggered player independent (e.g. by a schedule).

Run events player independent: runIndependentðŸ”—
persistent, static

Runs the specified event (or list of events) player independent (as if it was run from a schedule).

This is usefully for events that behave differently when run player independent.

Events that behave different if run player independent
Parameter	Syntax	Default Value	Explanation
events	events:events		Required. The events to be run, separated by ,.
Example

events:
    resetQuestForAll: "runIndependent events:removeObjective,clearTags,resetJournal"
Warning

There are a lot of events and conditions that cannot be run (or checked) player independent.
If you try to run such an event player independent (or check such a condition) this won't work, and you will get an error message in the console.

For more information on player independent events check this.

Scoreboard: scoreðŸ”—
persistent

This event works in the same way as point, the only difference being that it uses scoreboards instead of points. You can use action:add, action:subtract, action:set and action:multiply to change the value. It's only possible to change the value, you have to create the scoreboard target first.

Example

gotKill: "score kill 1 action:add"
gotKilled: "score kill 1 action:subtract"
resetKill: "score kill 0 action:set"
applyBonus: "score kill 1.2 action:multiply"
Scoreboard Tag: scoretagðŸ”—

Example


setblock REDSTONE_BLOCK 100;200;300;world
setblock SAND 100;200;300;world ignorePhysics
Modify Stage: stageðŸ”—
You can set, increase or decrease the player's stage. The objective will not automatically complete when using set. By increasing it the player will be able to complete the objective. When increasing or decreasing the stage you can optionally specify an amount to increase or decrease by.
When decreasing the objective it will do nothing when the first stage is reached.
When the conditions of the stage objective are not met, the stage of the player can not be modified.
For more take a look at the stage objective.

Parameter	Syntax	Default Value	Explanation
stage objective	Objective		The name of the stage objective
action	set, increase or decrease		The action to perform
stage	Stage		The name of the stage to set when set is used
amount	Number	1	The amount to increase or decrease by

Sudo: sudoðŸ”—
This event is similar to command event, the only difference is that it will fire a command as the player (often referred to as player commands). Additional commands can be defined by separating them with | character. If you want to use a | character in the message use \|. Variables are supported.

Looking for run as op? Looking for console commands?

Example

Tag: tagðŸ”—
persistent, static

This event adds a tag to or deletes a tag from the player. The first argument after event's name must be add or delete. Next goes the tag name. It can't contain spaces (though _ is fine). Multiple tags can be added and deleted separated by commas (without spaces).

Note: If the items aren't quest items don't use takeevent with player options in conversations! The player can drop items before selecting the option and pickup them after the event fires. Validate it on the NPCâ€™s reaction!

You can also specify notify keyword to display a simple message to the player about loosing items.

Example


take emerald:120,sword
take nugget:6 notify
take wand notify invOrder:Backpack
take money:50 invOrder:Backpack,Inventory
take armor invOrder:Armor,Offhand,Inventory,Backpack
Time: timeðŸ”—
persistent, static

Changes the time of the world. The time is represented in 24 hours format as a float number, so 0 is midnight, 12 is noon and 23 is 11 PM. For minutes, you can use floating point numbers, so 0.5 is half past midnight, 0.25 is quarter past midnight and so on. (0.1 hours is 6 minutes). It's possible to add or subtract time by using + or - prefix or to set the time by setting no prefix. Additionally, you can specify the world in which the time will be changed, by adding world:. Using the ticks argument changes the time like the vanilla command.

 Move the player: velocityðŸ”—
Parameter	Syntax	Default Value	Explanation
vector	vector:(x;y;z)		The values of the vector, which are decimal numbers, can be interpreted as absolute numbers like the coordinate or as relative directions. For more understanding the relative direction is similar to ^ ^ ^ in minecraft or in other words (sideways;upwards;forwards). Can be a variable.
direction	direction:directionType	absolute	There are 3 types how the vector can get applied to the player:
absolute won't change the vector at all.
relative will redirect the vector to the view of the player.
relative_y is a mix between absolute and relative. It will still direct to the view but only horizontally, so y will be absolute.
modification	modification:modificationType	set	Possible modifications are set and add. The modification type determines how the vector should be merged with the player's velocity. The player's velocity is the external force applied on the player.
Visual Explanation
Example

events:
  jumppad: "velocity vector:(2;0.8;4)"
  dash: "velocity vector:(0;0.1;1.3) direction:relative_y"

The prefix can be changed: The default (when no prefix is set) is the translated prefix from the messages.yml config in the user's language.
Note that every custom prefix is suffixed with :â €, so prefix:Library_password will require the user to enter Library password: myfancypassword.
To disable the prefix use an empty prefix: declaration, e.g. password myfancypassword prefix: events:success. Be aware of these side effects that come with disabling the prefix:

Nothing will be hidden on failure, so tries will be visible in chat and commands will get executed!
If a command was used to enter the password, the command will not be canceled on success and thus still be executed!
This ensures that even if your password is quest you can still execute the /quest command.
You can also add the ignoreCase argument if you want a password's capitalization to be ignored. This is especially important for regex matching.

If you want to trigger one or more events when the player failed to guess the password you can use the argument fail with a list of events (comma separated). With disabled prefix every command or chat message will trigger these events!

Example

objectives:
  theBetonPassword: 'password beton ignoreCase prefix:secret fail:failEvent1,failEvent2 events:message,reward'
  theBetonPasswordSpaced: 'password "beton quest" ignoreCase prefix:secret fail:failEvent1,failEvent2 events:message,reward'

Example

command "/warp %player% farms" events:event1,event2
command //replace_oak\_wood events:event1,event2
With this configuration, the command objective requires the player to execute /warp MyName farms to be completed. The command objective matches from the start of the command that was executed, therefore if the player executed /warp MyName farms other arguments it would still be completed.

Optional arguments:

ignoreCase: If provided, instructs the objective to ignore case for the command to match.
exact: If provided, requires an exact command match, not just the command start.
cancel: If provided, the objective will cancel the execution of the command on a match. This needs to be enabled to suppress the Unknown Command message when using custom commands.

Variable: variableðŸ”—
This objective is different. You cannot complete it, it will also ignore defined events and conditions. You can start it and that's it. While this objective is active though, everything the player types in chat (and matches a special pattern) will become a variable. The pattern is key: value. So if the player types MyFirstVariable: Hello!, it will create a variable called MyFirstVariable, which will resolve as a Hello! string. You can access them as objective properties. Let's say you defined this objective as CustomVariable in your objectives.yml file. You can access the variable in any conversation, event or condition with %objective.CustomVariable.MyFirstVariable% - and in the case of this example, it will resolve to Hello!. The player can type something else and the variable will change its value. Variables are per-player, so the value of one player's MyFirstVariable will be different from other players' MyFirstVariable values, depending on what they typed in chat. There is no limit to the amount of variables that can be created and assigned to players. To remove this objective, use objective delete event - there is no other way.

You can also use variable event to change variables stored in this objective. There is one optional argument, no-chat. If you use it, the objective won't be modified by what players type in chat which is only useful when you're also using the variable event.

Also, the key is interpreted in lower case. That means there is no difference between MyFirstVariable, myfirstvariable or MYfirstVARIABLE.

Example

storage: variable
storeChat: variable no-chat

Constant VariableðŸ”—
Constants are a bit different from other variables, as you can freely define the values of them. They are defined in the constants section like this:


constants:
  village_location: 100;200;300;world
  village_name: Concrete
To use a constant variable, you must use %constant.constantName%:


%constant.village_location%
%constant.village_name%
If you want to parse a variable from a different package, follow the same syntax as you would working across packages. The proper syntax is %questPackage>constant.constantName%.

BetonQuest Data TypesðŸ”—
Point VariableðŸ”—
This variable displays the amount of points you have in some category or amount of points you need to have to reach a number. The first argument is the name of a category and the second argument is either amount or left:x, where x is a number.


%point.reputation.amount%
%point.reputation.left:15%
Global Point VariableðŸ”—
static

This variable displays the amount of global points in some category or the amount of points needed to reach a number. The first argument is the name of a category and the second argument is either amount or left:x, where x is a number.


%globalpoint.global_knownusers.amount%
%globalpoint.global_knownusers.left:100%
Tag VariableðŸ”—
This variable displays whether the player has a tag or not. The variable will return true or false by default. If you add papiMode to the instruction it will return yes or no. You can translate the papiMode's result by changing the values of condition_variable_met and condition_variable_not_met in the messages.yml config.


%tag.test%
%tag.test.papiMode%
Global Tag VariableðŸ”—
static

This variable displays whether a global tag is set or not. The variable will return true or false by default. If you add papiMode to the instruction it will return yes or no. You can translate the papiMode's result by changing the values of condition_variable_met and condition_variable_not_met in the messages.yml config.


%globaltag.test%
%globaltag.test.papiMode%
Custom Text VariableðŸ”—
It is possible to save text per player. This works by using the variable objective and the variable event.

Other VariablesðŸ”—
Eval VariableðŸ”—
static

This variable allows you to resolve an expression containing variables, and the result will then be interpreted again as a variable. You need to escape the % inside eval with a backslash \ to prevent it from being interpreted as a delimiter. You can nest multiple evals, but this leads you to an escape hell. If you do so, you need to add one escape level with each nesting level, this means normally you write \% and in the next level you need to write \\\%.


%eval.player.\%objective.variableStore.displayType\%%
%eval.player.\%eval.objective.\\\%objective.otherStore.targetStore\\\%.displayType\%%
Item VariableðŸ”—
With this variable you can display different properties of a specific QuestItem. The first argument is the name of the item (as defined in the items section). The amount argument displays the number of items in the players inventory and backpack, the left:x gives the difference to the x value (when the amount is higher than the value it will be negative). The name argument simply gives the defined name or an empty String, when not set and lore:x displays the lore row with index x (starting with 0). Both name and lore supports the raw subargument to get the text without formatting.


%item.stick.amount%
%item.stick.left:32%
%item.epic_sword.name%
%item.epic_sword.lore:0.raw%
Item durability variableðŸ”—
With this variable you can display the durability of an item. The first argument is the slot. An optional argument is relative which will display the durability of the item relative to the maximum from 0 to 1, where 1 is the maximum. You can specify the amount of digits with the argument digits:x, where x is a whole number. This default is 2 digits. Additionally, you get the output in percent (inclusive the '%' symbol).


%itemdurability.HAND%
%itemdurability.CHEST.relative%
%itemdurability.CHEST.relative.percent%
%itemdurability.HEAD.relative.digits:5%
Location VariableðŸ”—
This variable resolves to all aspects of the player's location. The x, y and z coordinates, the world name, the yaw and pitch (head rotation). There are also modes for the Unified Location Formatting (ULF from now on) which means that this variable can also be used in events, conditions etc. If you just specify %location% the variables will resolve to a ULF with yaw and pitch. You can add two options to that base, one will give back parts of the ULF and the other will set to how many decimal places the variable will resolve.


%location%           # -> 325;121;814;myWorldName;12;6
%location.xyz%       # -> 325 121 814 
%location.x%         # -> 325
%location.y%         # -> 121
%location.z%         # -> 814
%location.yaw%       # -> 12
%location.pitch%     # -> 6
%location.world%     # -> myWorldName
%location.ulfShort%  # -> 325;121;814;myWorldName
%location.ulfLong%   # -> 325;121;814;myWorldName;12;6

%location.x.2%       # -> 325.16
%location.ulfLong.5% # -> 325.54268;121.32186;814.45824;myWorldName;12.0;6.0
Math VariableðŸ”—
static

This variable allows you to perform a calculation based on other variables (for example point or objective variables) and resolves to the result of the specified calculation. The variable always starts with math.calc:, followed by the calculation which should be calculated. Supported operations are +, -, *, /, ^ and %. You can use ( ) and [ ] braces and also calculate absolute values with | |. But be careful, don't use absolute values in the command event as it splits the commands at every | and don't nest them without parenthesis (|4*|3-5|| won't work, but |4*(|3-5|)| does). Additionally, you can use the round operator ~ to round everything left of it to the number of decimal digits given on the right. So 4+0.35~1 will produce 4.4 and 4.2~0 will produce 4.

To use variables in the calculation you have two options: First just write the variable, but without % around them; In cases where this doesn't work, e.g. if the variable contains mathematical operators, you can surround it with curly braces { }. Inside the curly braces you have to escape with \, so to have a \ in your variable you need to write \\, to have a } inside your variable you need to write \}.

When the calculation fails 0 will be returned and the reason logged.

Warning

The modulo operator needs to be escaped with a backslash \ to prevent it from being interpreted as a placeholder delimiter. If you don't want to escape the percentage and actually want to write a backslash you can use \\%. Don't forget to escape the backslash itself with another backslash if you are inside a double-quoted string ".


%math.calc:100*(15-point.reputation.amount)%
%math.calc:objective.kill_zombies.left/objective.kill_zombies.total*100~2%
%math.calc:-{ph.myplugin_stragee+placeholder}%
%math.calc:64\%32%
Npc VariableðŸ”—
static

This variable resolves information about a Npc. Specifying an argument determines the return: the Npc name, or full name (with formatting).

Arguments:
* name - Return Npc name
* full_name - Return Npc name with formatting

Example

%npc.bob.name%        # Bob
%npc.bob.full_name%   # &eBob
Npc Location VariableðŸ”—
This variable resolves to all Npc location. For details see the location variable. The general syntax is %npc.<id>.location.<mode>.<precision>%.

Example

%npc.mayor.location%           # -> 325;121;814;npcWorldName;12;6
%npc.mayor.location.xyz%       # -> 325 121 814 
%npc.mayor.location.ulfLong.5% # -> 325.54268;121.32186;814.45824;npcWorldName;12.0;6.0
Player Name VariableðŸ”—
The variable %player% is the same as %player.name% and will display the name of the player. %player.display% will use the display name used in chat and %player.uuid% will display the UUID of the player.


%player%
%player.name%
%player.display%
%player.uuid%
Quester Name (Conversation)ðŸ”—
When the player is in a conversation, this variable will contain the quester's name in the player's quest language. If the player is not in a conversation, the variable is empty.


%quester%
Random Number VariableðŸ”—
static

This variable gives a random number from the first value to the second. The first argument is whole or decimal, the second and third arguments are numbers or variables, separated by a ~. Like the math variable you can round the decimal value by using instead of decimal the argument decimal~x where x is the maximal amount of decimal places. Variables can be used with {} instead of %%. Note that the first value is returned when it is higher than the second.


%randomnumber.whole.0~10%
%randomnumber.whole.-70~70%
%randomnumber.decimal~3.3.112~100%
%randomnumber.decimal~1.0~{location.y}%
Version VariableðŸ”—
static

This variable displays the version of the plugin. You can optionally add the name of the plugin as an argument to display version of another plugin.


%version.Citizens%

SchedulesðŸ”—
Schedules allow you to run events periodically at specific times for the entire server.

Player independent eventsðŸ”—
Whenever events are run from a conversation or an objective, they are always run for a specific player. For events run from a schedule this is not the case as there is no specific player involved.
This means you can only use events that are player independent, like setblock or globaltag, in schedules. The same applies to the conditions used by these events.

To determine if an event is player independent (and can be used in schedules), look for the static flag in the docs.

Example

Set Block: setblock
persistent, static 

Changes the block at the given position.

Some events behave differently when called from a schedule in independent mode. For example, tag delete will include offline players. A list of all events that act differently can be found in the runIndependent docs.

But sometimes you might want your schedule to run a player dependent event, like message or give for all players on the server. To do this you can use the runforall event. It will run the given events for all players on the server. You can even use conditions to filter out players.

Realtime schedulesðŸ”—
Realtime schedules are, as the name already says, schedules that run at a specific real world time, for example at 12 o'clock each day. Do not confuse these with Minecraft's ingame time!

The time is provided by the system time of the computer your minecraft server is running on, in the systems time zone.

Daily realtime schedule: realtime-dailyðŸ”—
A super simple to use type of schedule, but also limited in its functionality.
Just specify the time of the day when the events should run, and they will run every day at that same time.


Simple Example
Full Example

schedules:
  sayGoodNight: 
    type: realtime-daily 
    time: '22:00' 
    events: bell_ring,notify_goodNight 
Runs every day at 10pm, will ring a bell and wish everyone a good night.


Warning

The time must always be in '' to avoid problems. It needs leading zero if less than 10.

Cron realtime schedule: realtime-cronðŸ”—
The cron realtime schedule is an incredibly flexible tool to define when events shall run.
It is similar to the realtime-daily schedule but the time is defined as a cron expression.
The supported syntax is identical to the original unix crontab syntax.

Tip

Crontab Guru is a great tool for learning and testing cron expressions. It also provides a long list of examples. BetonQuest supports all features listed there, even the non-standard ones!


Simple Example
Full Example

schedules:
  sayGoodNight: 
    type: realtime-cron 
    time: '0 22 * * *' 
    events: bell_ring,notify_goodNight 
Runs every day at 10pm, will ring a bell and wish everyone a good night.


The following special expressions were added for extended functionality or simpler usage:

Expression	Description	Equivalent to
@reboot	Run at server startup, before catching up any missed schedules	-
@hourly	Run once an hour at the beginning of the hour	0 * * * *
@daily / @midnight	Run once a day at 00:00	0 0 * * *
@weekly	Run once a week at 00:00 on Sunday morning	0 0 * * 0
@monthly	Run once a month at 00:00 of the first day of the month	0 0 1 * *
@yearly / @annually	Run once a year at 00:00 of 1 January	0 0 1 1 *
Catchup StrategiesðŸ”—
Obviously, scheduled events can't be run while the server is shut down.
If you want to be sure that a schedule will nevertheless be run, you can define a catchup strategy.

On startup, BetonQuest checks which schedules have been missed and (if needed) they will be run on the first tick.
Schedules of the same type will be run in the order they were missed. For mixed types the order can not be guaranteed.


NONE
ONE
ALL
Example

schedules:
  sayGoodNight: 
    type: realtime-daily
    time: '22:00'
    events: bell_ring,notify_goodNight
    catchup: none 
As it's just an announcement we don't need to repeat it. The right time has passed.


Danger

If the server was shut down for a long time, running all missed schedules can be a too heavy task for the server to handle.

For example using realtime-daily type with a syntax like * * * * * (run every minute) and catchup strategy ALL will create 86 400 missed shedules per day!

So be very cautious when using ALL catchup strategy!

By deleting .cache/schedules.yml before startup you can make BetonQuest forget about any missed schedules 

Conversations
In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of the conversations. These allow you to create a dialog between the player and a NPC. Therefore, these are the basic tool for story telling.

You can now find all files needed for this tutorial in this location: "YOUR-SERVER-LOCATION/plugins/BetonQuest/QuestPackages/tutorialQuest"
1. Linking a conversation to a NPCðŸ”—
Usually, conversations happen between a NPC and the player. Therefore, we need to create the npcs and npc_conversations sections in the package.yml so that the plugin knows which NPC uses which conversation. In this tutorial we will use Citizens. This is how it works:

package.yml

npcs:
  JackNpc: "citizens 1"
npc_conversations:
  JackNpc: "Jack"
This links the NPC with the given Citizens ID (1) to the conversation with the given identifier (Jack). Save the file after editing.
How to create a Citizens NPC? Where do I find the NPC's ID?
2. Creating your first conversationðŸ”—
It's time to create the first conversation with Jack! This chapter will teach you the basic structure of a conversation.

Let's take a look at how a conversation is defined in the plugin's files:

Tip: Click the plus buttons next to the text for explanations!

jack.yml

conversations:
  Jack: 
    quester: "Jack" 
    first: "firstGreeting" 
    NPC_options: 
      firstGreeting:
        text: "Hello and welcome to my town traveler! Nice to see you. Where are you from?"
        pointers: "whereYouFrom" 

    player_options: 
      whereYouFrom:
        text: "First I want to know who you are!"
A BetonQuest conversation is a cycle of responses between the NPC and the player. Anything the NPC says is called NPC_options, everything the player answers is called player_options.

A conversation always starts with an NPC_option. Now the player must answer the NPC using a player_option.

Options point to each other using the pointer argument. In the case of an NPC_option, the pointer argument would contain the name of a player_option. Usually, a player has more than one answer to choose from. This is done by adding multiple player_option names to a NPC_option.

After the player responded, they are shown another NPC_option that the previously chosen player_option points to.

Whenever either a player_option or a NPC_option point to no other option the conversation ends as there are no more responses or answers.

3. Trying the Conversation ingameðŸ”—
You can easily check if your quest is working on the server. Open the file "jack.yml" in the "conversations" folder. Copy the above conversation into it and save the file.

Now type /bq reload in the chat and right-click the NPC.

You can select the answer by pressing the jump key (Space by default).

4. Conversations with multiple choicesðŸ”—
Let's see how to create multiple responses for the player to choose from using the pointer argument.

A NPC_option can point to multiple player options at the same time. As soon as a pointer argument contains more than one player_option, the player can choose.

Tip: Highlighted lines in blue are new compared with the previous example.

jack.yml

conversations:
  Jack:
    quester: "Jack"
    first: "firstGreeting"
    NPC_options:
      firstGreeting:
        text: "Hello and welcome to my town traveler! Nice to see you. Where are you from?"
        pointers: "whereYouFrom"
      whoAmI:
        text: "I am &6Jack&r. The mayor of this beautiful town. We have some big farms and good old taverns well worth checking out! So now where are you from?"
        pointers: "smallIsland,bigCity" 
      islandAnswer: 
        text: "That sounds familiar! I grew up in a small town with few people. So we already have something in common! Do you want something to eat?"
      cityAnswer: 
        text: "Oh I know! I think you're from Kayra, right? Nice city but to be honest I prefer country life... You look a bit hungry. Do you want something to eat?"

    player_options:
      whereYouFrom: 
        text: "First I want to know who you are!"
        pointers: "whoAmI" 
      smallIsland: 
        text: "From a small island located east."
        pointers: "islandAnswer" 
      bigCity:  
        text: "From a big city located west."
        pointers: "cityAnswer" 
With these changes, the mayor asks the player where he is from. The player can either say that they are from a smallIsland or from a bigCity. This creates two different paths through the conversation.

5. Joining conversation pathsðŸ”—
Let's join these paths again to show the same ending:
Add the same pointer argument to both paths' NPC_options. They point to the new yesPlease player_option.

jack.yml

conversations:
  Jack:
    quester: "Jack"
    first: "firstGreeting"
    NPC_options:
      firstGreeting:
        text: "Hello and welcome to my town traveler! Nice to see you. Where are you from?"
        pointers: "whereYouFrom"
      whoAmI:
        text: "I am &6Jack&r. The mayor of this beautiful town. We have some big farms and good old taverns well worth checking out! So now where are you from?"
        pointers: "smallIsland,bigCity"
      islandAnswer:
        text: "That sounds familiar! I grew up in a small town with few people. So we already have something in common! Do you want something to eat?"
        pointers: "yesPlease" 
      cityAnswer:
        text: "Oh I know! I think you're from Kayra, right? Nice city but to be honest I prefer country life... You look a bit hungry. Do you want something to eat?"
        pointers: "yesPlease" 
      foodAnswer:
        text: "You're welcome! Take it... &7*gives food*"

    player_options:
      whereYouFrom:
        text: "First I want to know who you are!"
        pointers: "whoAmI"
      smallIsland:
        text: "From a small island located east."
        pointers: "islandAnswer"
      bigCity:
        text: "From a big city located west."
        pointers: "cityAnswer"
      yesPlease: 
        text: "Oh yes I'm starving! Thank you."
        pointers: "foodAnswer"
The following graph shows the paths through the conversation. Since there are two pointers assigned to the whoAmI option, the player can choose between one of the paths.

SummaryðŸ”—
You've learned how to create simple conversations in which the player can choose different paths. In the next part of the basics tutorial you will learn how Jack the mayor can give food to the player using events!

Conversations
Conversations are the main way to interact with players in BetonQuest. They are used to display text, ask questions and execute commands. This page contains the reference documentation for all conversation related features. Consider doing the conversation tutorial if you are just getting started.

General InformationðŸ”—
A conversation is a sequence of questions and answers. It is started by a NPC and can be ended by both the player or the NPC.

Example conversation

conversations: 
  mayorHans: 
    quester: "Hans the Mayor" 
    first: "welcome,blacksmithReminder" 
    stop: "true"  
    final_events: "setCityState" 
    interceptor: "simple" 
    NPC_options: 
      welcome:
        text: "Good day, dear %player%! Welcome back to my town." 
        events: "playSound,giveMoney" 
        conditions: "firstVisit,!criminal" 
        pointers: "friendly,hostile" 
      blacksmithReminder:
        text: "Please visit the blacksmith, he has a task for you."
        conditions: "!criminal"
      howDareYou:
        text: "How dare you to talk to me like that?! Get out of my sight!"
    player_options: 
      friendly:
        text: "Thank you your honor, I'm happy to be here."
        events: "givePresent"
        pointers: "blacksmithReminder"
      hostile:
        text: "Your Honor, I come bearing a ultimatum letter from the people. They have grown tired of your corruption and greed."
        conditions: 'hasUltimatumLetter'
        pointers: "howDareYou"
When an NPC wants to say something he will check conditions for the first option (in this case welcome). If they are met, he will choose it. Otherwise, he will skip to next option (note: conversation ends when there are no options left to choose). After choosing an option the NPC will execute any events defined in it and say it's text. Then the player will see options defined in the player_options branch to which the pointers setting points, in this case friendly and hostile. If the conditions for a player options is not met, the option is simply not displayed, similar to texts from NPC. The player will choose the option they want, and it will point back to other NPC text, which points to next player options and so on.

If there are no possible options for player or NPC (either from not meeting any conditions or being not defined) the conversations ends. If the conversation ends unexpectedly, check the console - it could be an error in the configuration.

This can and will be a little confusing, so you should name your options, conditions and events in a way which you will understand in the future. Don't worry though, if you make some mistake in configuration, the plugin will tell you this when running /q reload.

Binding Conversations to NPCsðŸ”—
Conversations can be assigned to NPCs. This is done in the npc_conversations section:

Example

npc_conversations:
  Hans: mayorHans 
A NPC will only react to right clicks by default. This can be changed by setting npcs.accept_left_click in the "config.yml" to true.

You can assign the same conversation to multiple NPCs. It is not possible to assign multiple conversations to one NPC. For this purpose, have a look at cross-conversation-pointers though.

Conversation displayingðŸ”—
BetonQuest provides different conversation styles, so called "conversationIO's". They differ in their visual style and the way the player interacts with them.

BetonQuest uses the menu style by default. If ProtocolLib is not installed, the chest style will be used. You can change this setting globally by changing the default_io option in the "config.yml" file.

It is also possible to override this setting per conversation. Add a conversationIO: <type> setting to the conversation file at the top of the YAML hierarchy (which is the same level as quester or first options).

In both cases, you can choose from the following conversation styles:

Conversation Styles


menu
chest
combined
simple
tellraw
slowtellraw
A modern conversation style that works with some of Minecraft's native controls.

Requires ProtocolLib

Customizing the Menu Style
 The blue overlay shows the player's key presses.


Cross-Conversation PointersðŸ”—
If you want to create a conversation with multiple NPCs at once or split a huge conversation into smaller, more focused files, you can point to both NPC and player options in other conversations. Use the cross-package syntax to do so.

There is one special case when you want to refer to the starting options of another conversation. In this case you do not specify an option name after the point (package>conversation.).

Cross-conversation Pointers Examples

myConversationOption:
  text: "Look carefully at that guard over there..."
  pointers: "lookCareful,guardConv.lookDetected,mainStory>Mirko.interrupt" 
specialOption:
  text: "This option points to the starting options of the conversation 'guardConv' in the package 'myPackage'."
  pointers: "myPackage>guardConv."
Conversation VariablesðŸ”—
You can use variables in the conversations. They will be resolved and displayed to the player when he starts a conversation. Check the variables list for more information about which variables exist.

Note

If you use a variable incorrectly (for example trying to get a property of an objective which isn't active for the player, or using %quester% in message event), the variable will be replaced with empty string ("").

TranslationsðŸ”—
Conversation can be fully translated into multiple languages. A players can choose their preferred language with the /questlang command. You can translate every NPC option, player option and the NPC's name. This is how it's done:


quester:
  en-US: "Innkeeper"
  pl-PL: "Karczmarz"
  de-DE: "Gastwirt"
first: "example1" 
NPC_options:
  example1:
    text:
      en-US: "Good day, dear %player%! Welcome back to my town."
      de-DE: "Guten Tag, lieber %player%! Willkommen zurÃ¼ck in meiner Stadt." 
player_options:
  example2:
    text:
      en-US: "Thank you your honor, I'm happy to be here."
      de-DE: "Danke, Euer Ehren, ich bin froh, hier zu sein."
en-US and de-DE are identifiers of languages present in the lang folder. If the conversation is not translated in the players' language, the plugin will fall back to the default language, as defined in "config.yml".
The same syntax can be applied in a few other features, e.g. the journal entries, quest cancelers and notify events.

Chat InterceptorsðŸ”—
While engaged in a conversation, it can be distracting when messages from other players or system messages interfere with the dialogue. A chat interceptor provides a method of intercepting those messages and then sending them after the conversation has ended.

You can specify the default chat interceptor by setting default_interceptor inside the "config.yml". Additionally, you can overwrite the default for each conversation by setting the interceptor key inside your conversation file.

The default configuration of BetonQuest sets the default_interceptor option to packet,simple. This means that it first tries to use the packet interceptor. If that fails it falls back to using the simple interceptor.

BetonQuest adds following interceptors: simple, packet and none:

The simple interceptor works with every server but only supports very basic functionality and may not work with plugins like Herochat.

The packet interceptor requires the ProtocolLib plugin to be installed. It will work well in any kind of situation.

The none interceptor is an interceptor that won't intercept messages. That sounds useless until you have a conversation that you want to be excluded from interception. In this case you can just set interceptor: none inside your conversation file.

Advanced: ExtendsðŸ”—
Conversations also support the concept of inheritance. Any option can include the key extends with a comma delimited list of other options of the same time. The first option that does not have any false conditions will have its text, pointers and events merged with the extending option. The extended option may itself extend other options. Infinite loops are detected.


NPC_options:

  ## Normal Conversation Start
  start:
    text: 'What can I do for you'
    extends: tonight,today

  ## Useless addition as example
  tonight:
    # Always false
    conditions: random_0-1
    text: ' tonight?'
    extends: main_menu

  today:
    text: ' today?'
    extends: main_menu

  ## Main main_menu
  main_menu:
    pointers: i_have_questions,bye
In the above example, the option start is extended by both tonight and today, both of whom are extended by main_menu. As tonight has a false condition the today option will win. The start option will have the pointers in main_menu added to it just as if they were defined directly in it and the text will be joined together from today. If you structure your conversation correctly you can make use of this to minimize duplication.

Text Formatting
Work in Progress

This feature is still in development and does not work for every feature at the moment. Some features are marked as limited, that means that things like hover and click events are not supported. Currently supported are:

Notify and NotifyAll Event
Compass Names
Conversation
Journal
NPC Name Variable (limited)
Quest Cancler (limited)
Plugin Messages / Translations (limited)
Every string in BetonQuest can be formatted with a formatter. A formatter is a way to format a string with colors, styles, and more, while each formatter has its own syntax.

In the "config.yml" file, you can set the default formatter with the text_parser setting. The default formatter is legacyminimessage.

Anyway each string can set an individual formatter by prefixing the string with @[FormatterName].

FormatterðŸ”—
LegacyðŸ”—

legacy
The legacy formatter is the old common way to format strings. It's a really simple formatter that has a lot of limitations, but it is still used by the community as it is the most known one. It uses the & or Â§ character followed by a color code or a style code character.

You can read everything about minecraft formatting here.

This formatter actually can parse a bit more as normally, like links get clickable, and colors in the adventure format Â§#a25981 or the BungeeCord RGB format Â§xÂ§aÂ§2Â§5Â§9Â§8Â§1.

You can read everything about these formats here.

Example


text1: '&cHello &e&lWorld'
text2: '@[legacy]&cHello &e&lWorld'
MiniMessageðŸ”—

minimessage
MiniMessage is the new standard for formatting strings. It's a really advanced formatter that has a lot of features. The formatting is based on tags like <red> and <bold>. You don't need to close them like </red>, but that sometimes make it clear what exactly you are formatting.

Everything about this format can be read here.

Example


text1: '<red>Hello <yellow><bold>World</bold>'
text2: '@[minimessage]<red>Hello <yellow><bold>World</bold>'
Legacy & MiniMessageðŸ”—

legacyminimessage
This formatter is a combination of the legacy and MiniMessage formatter. It allows you to use both formats. In that way, you can use the format that fits the best for every string. You can also use both formats in one string, but you need to be careful with that, as it can lead to unexpected results.

Example


text1: '&cHello <yellow><bold>World</bold>'
text2: '@[legacyminimessage]&cHello <yellow><bold>World</bold>'
MineDownðŸ”—

minedown
This formatter is a perfect alternative to MiniMessage. Mainly, it still supports the old legacy format, but also the new RGB format, as well as some more simple formatting. You don't need to write these tags like in MiniMessage, instead you write more advanced formats like this [Text](format).

You can read everything about this format here.

Example


text1: '[Hello](red) [World](yellow bold)'
text2: '@[minedown][Hello](red) [World](yellow bold)

NPCs
NPCs are an essential part of every RPG for player ingame interaction. In BetonQuest NPCs can be used to start conversations or interact with them otherwise, as shown in the Scripting and Visual Effects section of the documentation.

Info

This NPC is not related to the NPC/Quester in Conversations

Provided IntegrationsðŸ”—
BetonQuest provides Integrations for the following Npc plugins:

Citizens
MythicMobs
FancyNpcs
ZNPCsPlus
Referring an NPCðŸ”—
Npcs are defined in the npcs section.


Citizens
MythicMobs
FancyNpcs
ZNPCsPlus
Example

npcs:
  innkeeper: citizens 0
  mayorHans: citizens 4
  guard: citizens Guard byName
You simply use the Citizens NPC id as argument. To acquire the NPCs ID select the NPC using /npc select, then run /npc id.

You can also get a NPC by its name with the byName argument. That is useful when you have many NPCs with the same name which should all start the same conversation or count together in the npcinteract and npckill objectives.


Warning

If there are more NPCs than one NPC with the same name, and you select multiple NPCs by name (like by using Citizens byName option) certain events like npcteleport or objectives like npcrange might throw an exception.

ConversationsðŸ”—
You can start Conversations with NPC interaction by assigning them in the npc_conversations section of a quest package.

NPC Hiding: hide_npcsðŸ”—
You can hide NPCs for certain players using conditions. You can find information about it here.

MenusðŸ”—
BetonQuest allows the creation of fully custom GUIs using the events and items system.
Nearly everything can be done with these, from guis listing open quests over simple warp systems to information GUIs that display player stats.

Menu example

 Try the working example for a quick overview.

Creating a menuðŸ”—
To create a new menu just create a menus section in any file inside a quest package. The name which can be used to identify each menu will be the name of another section as shown below.

Menu Definition Example

menus:
  myMenuName:
    title: "My Menu Title"
    slots: #...
menu_items: #...
items: #...
General Menu SettingsðŸ”—
These are general settings for customizing a menu.

Required SettingsðŸ”—
Setting Name	
Example
Description
title	title: "&6&lQuests"	Will be displayed in the top left corner of your menu. You can use color codes to color the title. Variables and defining languages are supported.
height	height: 3	How many lines of slots your menu will have. Minimum 1, Maximum 6.
Optional SettingsðŸ”—
Setting Name
Example	Description
open_conditions	open_conditions: "unlockedMenu,!sneaking"	One or multiple conditions (separated by a ,) which all have to be true to open the menu with a bound item or a bound command.
open_events	open_events: "menuOpenSound"	One or multiple events (separated by a ,) which will be fired when the menu is opened.
close_events	close_events: "menuCloseSound"	One or multiple events (separated by a ,) which will be fired when the menu is closed.
bind	bind: "openMenuItem"	Clicking with this quest item in hand will open the menu. You can create this item in the items section of your package.
command	command: "/quests"	This command can be executed to open the menu.
The menu_items sectionðŸ”—
The items section contains all items which should be displayed in the menu, defined as individual sections of the config.

A basic item section looks like this:

Item Section Example

menus:
  myMenuName:
    title: "My Menu Title"
    slots: #...
menu_items: 
  skeletonQuestDone: 
    item: "questDoneItem" 
  goldQuestDone: 
    item: "questDone"
Optional Item SettingsðŸ”—
The three basic optional settings.

Name
Example	Description
amount	amount: 30	The size of the stack that will be displayed in the menu. Variables are supported.
conditions	conditions: "questDone"	One or multiple conditions (separated by a ,) which all have to be true to display the item.
close	close: true	If set to true the menu will be closed after clicking the item. If this is not set the default_close value from the plugins config will be used.
The optional text settingðŸ”—
By default, the name and description of the quest item is displayed when hovering over the item. You can overwrite this by using the text setting. If you only define one line, only the name will be overwritten. Both color codes and variables are supported and carried into the next line, if not overridden. The text can be provided as a single string with newlines, a multi-line string, or a list of strings, see examples.


List
String with Newlines
Multi-line String
List Example

skeletonQuestDone:
  item: "questDoneItem"
  text:
    - "&2Reputation: &6&l%point.quest_reputation.amount%"
    - "Make quests to gain reputation!"

Just like the text in conversations you can provide translations for all languages:

Translation Example

menu_items:
  skeletonQuestDone:
    item: "questDoneItem"
    text:
       en-US: 
         - "&7[Quest] &6&lThe lost amulet"
         - "&4&o"
         - "&eLeft click to locate npc"
         - "&eRight click to cancel quest"
       de-DE: 
         - "&7[Quest] &6&lDas verlorene Amulet"
         - "&4&o"
         - "&eLinksclick um den NPC zu finden"
         - "&eRechstclick um die Quest abzubrechen"
The optional click settingðŸ”—
You can define one or multiple events (separated by ,) that are run whenever the item is clicked.

Example

items:
  skeletonQuestDone:
    item: "simple questDoneItem"
    click: "simple startQuest,closeMenu"
Click TypesðŸ”—
Different types of clicks can be distinguished:

Click Types Example

  skeletonQuestDone:
    item: "questDoneItem"
    click:
      left: "give_xp,msg_give_xp" 
      shiftLeft: "give_xp,take_xp" 
      right: "take_xp,msg_take_xp" 
      shiftRight: "take_xp,msg_take_xp" 
      middleMouse: "msg_beautifull_text" 
The slots sectionðŸ”—
The slots section defines where the items from the items section should be displayed.
You can also assign multiple items to the same slot and use conditions in the items section to specify which one should be used. If you assign multiple items the first one for which all conditions are true will be displayed.


menus:
  myMenuName:
    title: "My Menu Title"
    slots:
      8: "reputation" 
      9: "questStarted,questCompleted" 
Slot Numbers
Row AssignmentðŸ”—
You can also assign multiple items to a row of slots. Now the slots are filled up one by one using the items whose conditions are true:


10-12: "quest1,quest2,quest3" 
Rectangle AssignmentðŸ”—
Additionally, you can also assign items to a rectangle of slots. Just like with the row, the slots in this rectangle are filled up one by one using the items whose conditions are true


14*25: "quest1,quest2,quest3"
RectangleExample

Basic Menu ExampleðŸ”—
This is an example of a basic menu that displays the progress of two quests.

Example

UsageðŸ”—
You can copy and paste this example into any file in a package. Then reload and execute the command /q give YOUR_PACKAGE>openMenuItem to get the item that opens the menu.

Read the related docs in the menu section to learn more about these configuration options.

Elements
EventsðŸ”—
Menu Event: menuðŸ”—
This event can be used to open, close or update menus. The first argument is the type of action that should be done. It is either open to open a new menu, close to close the currently opened menu, or update to update the content of the currently opened menu.
If you want to open a menu you have to add a second argument which should be the id of a menu. If you want to open menus from other packages just use the cross package format.

Example: menu open quest_gui

Example: menu close

Example: menu update

ConditionsðŸ”—
Menu Condition: menuðŸ”—
This condition can be used to check if the player has currently opened any menu. You can add id: optional and specify the id of a menu to check if the player has opened the menu with this id. If you want to check for menus from other packages just use the cross package format.

Example: menu id:quest_gui

ObjectivesðŸ”—
Menu Objective: menuðŸ”—
This objective is completed when the player opens the menu with the given id. The only required argument is the id of the menu. If you want to use menus from other packages just use the cross package format.

The objective also has the property menu which can be used by the objective variable. It returns the title of the menu which should be opened.

Example: menu quest_gui

VariablesðŸ”—
Menu Variable: menuðŸ”—
This variable displays the title of the menu that is currently opened by the player. If no menu is opened it will be just empty.

Example: %menu%
